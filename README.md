Clone folder to your home directory and run `stow the-folder-to-stow` to create symlinks of all files in the dotfiles folder to the corresponding location in your home directory.

Example:

In this project we have a folder called emacs/ containing an .emacs.d/ folder with some files inside.

To create symlinks to these files in the home directory, simply run `stow emacs` from the project root.
